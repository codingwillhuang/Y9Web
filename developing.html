<h2>Design Specifications</h2>
<p><b>Summary: </b>The World Health Organization currently holds tabular data about a variety of health related topics stored in JSON data files. Unfortunately this data is difficult to comprehend due to its presentation. A solution to this problem is to create a graphical representation of this data using web development aspects like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and GitHub Pages. From the analysis of existing products like Population.io, WorldBank, and OurWorldInData, I have learned the benefits and disadvantages of websites concerning health related topics. 
<br>
<br>The eventual product of the solution will be an interactive web page that contains various ways to view the World Health Organization JSON data about homicide rates. <u>The web page will have a simple and balanced layout of widgets, and functions which will create a user-friendly environment for the target audience. The solution must contain various graphics like bar and line graphs of the JSON data for the understanding of the user. Also, in order to create an aesthetically pleasing user-interface, CSS colours, borders, and themes will be utilized. All of these aspects are integral to the solution of the problem.</u>


<p><b>Success Criteria: </b>
<br>1. Use JSON data effectively (Homicides per 100 000 people by country)
<br>2. Design will have navigation bar containing links to other parts of project and will have rooted position when scrolling(Home/logo, Inquiry, About)
<br>3. Design will have pull down with all countries in alphabetical order.
<br>4. Design will have compare feature between two countries
<br>5. Design will have bar graph or line graph or both
<br>6. Design will have link/button to original tabular data from WHO
<br>7. Design will have slider that relates to 'Time' in those graphs
<br>8. Design will have gender options to specify data selection
<br>9. Design will cited sources and bibliography at bottom of page
<br>10. Design will have colour theme (dark mode, light mode)
<br>11. Design will have CSS buttons, fonts, borders, colours (hover colour buttons, rounded corners)
<br>12. Design will have health topic related animations
<br>13. Design web page will load fairly quickly due to code placement and no useless code
<br>14. Design web page will have help button that contains instructions
<br>15. Design web page will have short description of chosen individual country

<h2>Feasible Designs</h2>
<p><b>Note: </b>The following annotations of the images will sometimes appear with a (S#). This bracket form refers to the success criteria and the specific step that is being fulfilled.(S#) = (Step Number)</p>

<h2>Chosen Designs</h2>
<p><b>Present: </b></p>
<img id="design1" border="5"width="500" height="500 margin: auto"
src="IMG_0085.jpg">
<p><b>Justify: </b>Out of the two annotated feasible designs, I chose Design 1. Design 1 meets with the success criteria and ultimate goals of the solution better than Design 2. The first design offers a simple and balanced layout of widgets and funcitonality that creates a user-friendly environment for the target audience of teen students. While the chosen design provides invidvidual statistics of a chosen country and gender near the top of the page, the bottom of the page contains the compare function and animation detailing the individual country.
<br>
<br>Design 1 contains multiple graphics that help display the JSON data of homicide rates which include bar and line graphs. The graph functions are not too simple nor complex for the intended audience. Also, Design 1 has two animations that relate better to the topic of homicide than Design 2. Underneath the navigation bar of Design 1 and near the botttom right corner are animations about homicde (gun shots, poison). The animations along with the future colour theme (red, blue, green, white) will contribute to an aesthetically pleasing user-interface.
