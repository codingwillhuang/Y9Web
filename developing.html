<h2>Design Specifications</h2>
<p><b>Summary: </b>The World Health Organization currently holds tabular data about a variety of health related topics stored in JSON data files. Unfortunately this data is difficult to comprehend due to its presentation. A solution to this problem is to create a graphical representation of this data using web development aspects like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and GitHub Pages. From the analysis of existing products like Population.io, WorldBank, and OurWorldInData, I have learned the benefits and disadvantages of websites concerning health related topics. The eventual product of the solution will be an interactive web page that contains various ways to view the World Health Organization JSON data about homicide rates. The web page will have a simple and balanced layout of widgets, and functions which will create a user-friendly environment. The solution must contain various graphics like bar and line graphs of the JSON data for the understanding of the user. Also, in order to create an aesthetically pleasing user-interface, CSS colours, borders, and themes will be utilized. All of these aspects are integral to the solution of the problem.


<p><b>Success Criteria: </b>
<br>1. Use JSON data effectively (Homicides per 100 000 people by country)
<br>2. Design will have navigation bar containing links to other parts of project (Home, Inquiry, Dev.Ideas, About)
<br>3. Design will have pull down with all countries  
<br>4. Design will have compare feature between two countries
<br>5. Design will have bar graph
<br>6. Design will have line graph
<br>7. Design will have slider that relates to 'Time' in those graphs
<br>8. Design will have gender options to specify data selection
<br>9. Design will cited sources and bibliography at bottom of page
<br>10. Design will have colour theme (dark mode, light mode)
<br>11. Design will have CSS buttons, fonts, borders
