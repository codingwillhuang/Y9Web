<h1>Inquiry and Analysis</h1>

<hr>

<h2>Explanation and Justification</h2>
<p><b>Explain: </b>The World Heath Organization website currently contains massive amounts of data about a multitude of health related topics. There are many important topics that can range from diseases to life expectancy. All this data is organized by country and can be easily accessed through the World Health Organization data repository. Specifically, the statistics about homicides are located in section 16.1 Violence which will be the main focus for the later part of this project. The thousands of data cells about homicides by country are all compacted into a single JSON file. A JSON file is a file that stores simple data structures and objects in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format, which is a standard data interchange format. It is primarily used for transmitting data between a web application and a server.

<p><b>Justify: </b>Much of the tabular data presented in the JSON files found on the World Heath Organization website are visually unappealing and difficult to understand because of the lack of presentation. Due to this flaw, many spectators are unable to learn from the health data as desired. However, due to the power of web development, this valuable data can be transformed into an athaestically pleasing website that is comprehensible. HTML can be used to build the structure of the website, CSS can be responsible for the stylistic choices, and JavaScript can be utilized for behavioural aspects of the website. Mainly, the HTML canvas tag opens up opportunities for a variety of options to view data graphically. It is extremely important to be able to provide a  graphical solution to JSON data so that the target audience is able to understand and learn information from the World Heatlh Organization.</p>

<p><b>Target Audience: </b>The target audience for this solution is mainly teen students. The grade range for this target audience is from Grade 8 - Grade 10.</p>

<h2>Research Plan</h2>
<p><b>Construct: </b>In order to develop a solution to this problem independently, a systematic approach must be undertaken involving research. Many of the skills needed to develop a solution require web development skills. This means that basic research must be performed on the important aspects of web development like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Also, research must be done on specific parts of web development that will help with graphical presentation. The majority of this research will be done online and through the website W3 Schools since it is a great source that provides a variety of tutorials about web developement. </p>

<p><b>Identify and Prioritize: </b>1. <u>Basic HTML5</u> - HTML is responsible for the much of the structure of a website. Without HTML there would be no website in the first place. Research would include things like canvas, headings, and tables. 2.  <u>Basic CSS</u> - Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is essential to make a website visually appealing. CSS research would include colours, backgrounds, and borders etc. 3. <u>GitHub Pages</u> - GitHub is an online platform that allows users to compile their code into various repositories for public use. GitHub also has an important feature called GitHub Pages which allows users to publish their own websites for anyone in the world to view. Research of GitHub Pages will include research of important Git commands like add, commit, and push which is important to help update your code to GitHub Pages. 4.  <u>Basic JavaScript</u> - JavaScript is an aspect of web development that adds dynamic to a website. Research for JavaScript would include variables, objects, and functions.</p>
