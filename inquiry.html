<h1>Inquiry and Analysis</h1>

<hr>

<h2>Explanation and Justification</h2>
<p><b>Explain: </b>The World Heath Organization website currently contains massive amounts of data about a multitude of health related topics. Important topics can range from diseases to road deaths. All this data is organized by country and can be easily accessed through the World Health Organization data repository. Specifically, the statistics about homicides are located in section 16.1 Violence which will be the main focus for the later part of this project. The thousands of data cells about homicides by country are all compacted into a single JSON file. 

<p><b>Justify: </b>Much of the tabular data presented in the JSON files found on the World Heath Organization website are visually unappealing and difficult to understand because of the lack of presentation. However, due to the power of web development, this valuable data can be transformed into an athaestically pleasing website that is comprehensible. HTML can be used to build the structure of the website, CSS can be responsible for the stylistic choices, and JavaScript can be utilized for behavioural aspects of the website. Mainly, the HTML canvas tag opens up opportunities for a variety of options to view data graphically. It is extremely important to be able to provide a  graphical solution to JSON data so that the target audience is able to understand and learn information from WHO.</p>

<p><b>Target Audience: </b>The target audience for this solution is mainly teen students. The grade range for this target audience is Grade 8 - Grade 10.</p>
