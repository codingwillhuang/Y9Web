<p><b>Note: </b> The following list is the success criteria of my design during my <a href="developing.html">Developing Ideas</a> stage. However, now that I am relfecting on the success criteria I have organized the list by completion through colour. <br> Green = Complete <br> Red = Did Not Complete <br> Black = Somewhat Complete</p>

<br>
<br>

<p><b>Justification of Changes: </b> The first justifications of my changes to design will be on the aspects of my success criteria that I did not complete. On my current website, I do not have a slider that relates 'Time' in any of my bar graphs. Although I was able to find examples of sliders of the x-axis of a graph, I was not able to apply this same concempt to my own homicide data. I researched W3 Schools along with StackOverflow about sliders but did not understand most of the javascript. I believe that with more time I would be able to understand more about the coding and perhaps apply it to my website. However, I think that not having a time slider for my website is actually beneficial in some ways. The data presented on my graphs are striclty from 2016 which is the most recent year from the data set. I think that users of the website are more interested in seeing homicide rates from the most recent year rather than the past.
<br>
<br>
The second piece of the success criteria was the cited sources and bibliography. This change to design was mostly due to time constraints of the project itself. This was a part of my design that was not my primary focus and was left last in terms of prioritization. From my research of other health-related websites, I can say that it can be distracting at times for the user to see various bibliographies and information not related to the site. So I do not think that this was the most important aspect of my success criteria to achieve.
<br>
<br>
The final aspects of my success criteria that I was not able to complete are much alike in terms of justification. I did not create health topic related animations and my website did not have a short description of the chosen individual country. Both of these steps I did not complete due to time constraints of the project and lack of understanding. I found many animations relating to my own topic of homicides but, it was difficult to replicate the success of those animations. I also tried researching various wikipedia API tutorials to figure out how to scrape text from wikipedia pages. Unfortunately, I was unable to complete either of these tasks.
<br>
<br>
Now the steps of the success criteria I will be explaining are the steps that are somewhat complete. One of the most crucial steps of my success criteria was that I will have a bar graph or line graph or both. I was aiming to have both a line graph and a bar graph on my website but, I only ended up coding multiple bar graphs. I was unable to create a line graph because of a lack of knowledge about the coding and I was not able to make certain online examples compatible with my own WHO data. Although I wanted a line graph, I believe that the current bar graphs are easier to comprehend and navigate through for the average user of my site. Line graphs can be at times confusing for the average user and would have the same effect as the current bar graphs.
<br>
<br>
The final partial to my design involved the colour theme. In my success criteria, I stated that I would have something along the lines of a dark mode and light mode which would have involved a button. However, I chose to change my design to a white, red, green, and blue colour theme. I think that this was a needed change for my design because it was more aesthetically pleasing for the user rather than two plain colours like black and white. This change of colour also made the graphics of the homicide data stand out more and fulfilled the ultimate goal of this project which was to provide a graphical solution to boring tabular data.
